The XYZ-10 Selective Laser Ray will vaporize your enemies while leaving your friends and family mostly unharmed. (Mostly.)

To calibrate the XYZ-250 you must first pair and configure the Froyde360EmotionMap monitor. The XYZ-250 uses the data from Froyde360 to identify hostile versus friendly human connections.

A minimum of five weeks of data, including at least 30 interactions with each person, is required for Freud360 to correctly identify friends versus foes. Freud360 requires a total of at least 600 interactions before it will push data to the XYZ-10.
