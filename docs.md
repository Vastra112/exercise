The XYZ-10 Selective Laser Beam will vaporize your enemies while leaving your friends and family mostly unharmed. (Mostly.)

To calibrate the XYZ-1000 you must first pair and configure the Froyde360 EmotionMap monitor. The XYZ-1000 uses the data from Froyde360 to identify hostile versus friendly human connections.

A minimum of five weeks of input, including at least 30 interactions with each person, is required for Freud360 to correctly identify friends versus foes. Freud360 requires a total of at least 600 interactions before it will push data to the XYZ-10.

The module requires 24 hours of charging time.
